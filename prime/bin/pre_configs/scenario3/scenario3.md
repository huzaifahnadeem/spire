# Scenario 3:
- Start with 2 control centers + 1 data center
- In anticipation of the hurricane, we replace one vulnerable control center with a preemptively deployed mobile control center
- After hurricane passes and both original CCs are operational, we go back to the original configuration

---

1. System initialized with 3 sites: 2 Control Centers (CC1, CC2) and 1 Data Center (DC). Each site runs 6 replicas.

2. In anticipation of a hurricane, Control Center 2 is replaced with a preemptively deployed Mobile Control Center (MCC).

3. After the hurricane passes, both original control centers are operational.

4. System reconfigured: returned to original configuration with CC1, CC2, and DC.

Scenario 3: Proactive Reconfiguration for Disaster Preparedness

This scenario shows how the system can proactively reconfigure in anticipation of a threat to ensure continued availability.

Initial configuration:

    2 Control Centers (CC1 and CC2)

    1 Data Center (DC)

    Each site runs 6 replicas

In anticipation of a natural disaster:

    CC2 is preemptively replaced by a Mobile Control Center (MCC) to avoid service disruption

After the threat passes:

    Both original control centers (CC1 and CC2) are confirmed operational

    The system reverts to its original 3-site configuration
